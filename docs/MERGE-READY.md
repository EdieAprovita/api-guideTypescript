## 🎯 WHAT'S INCLUDED

### Phase 1: Environment Standardization
✅ **Status**: Complete and merged to feature branch

**Changes**:
- Fixed `process.env.DB` → `process.env.MONGODB_URI` in test mock
- Removed unnecessary `Promise.resolve()` (SonarQube best practice)

**Files**:
- `src/test/__mocks__/database.ts`

**Tests**: 179/179 passing

---

### Phase 2: Swagger Standardization
✅ **Status**: Complete and merged to feature branch

**Changes**:
- Added standardized `POST /:id/reviews` routes to 7 resources
- Updated swagger.yaml with 5 new OpenAPI 3.0 paths
- Created automation script for future updates
- Maintained 100% backward compatibility

**Files Modified**:
- Route files: 7 (businesses, doctors, restaurants, markets, recipes, sanctuaries, professions)
- Swagger: `swagger.yaml` (3431 lines)
- Automation: `scripts/update-swagger.py` (new)

**Tests**: 179/179 passing

---

### Phase 3: Code Review Fix
✅ **Status**: Complete and merged to feature branch

**Issue**: Route shadowing in restaurantRoutes.ts
- Duplicate `POST /:id/reviews` was intercepting `POST /:restaurantId/reviews`
- Removed shadowing route to restore proper validation execution

**Files**:
- `src/routes/restaurantRoutes.ts`

**Tests**: 179/179 passing (no regressions)

## 📌 IMPORTANT NOTES

### Breaking Changes
❌ **None** - 100% backward compatible

### Deprecations
⚠️ **None** - Legacy routes maintained indefinitely

### Database Migrations
❌ **Not required** - No schema changes

### Environment Variables
✅ **Standardized** to `MONGODB_URI` (GCP Secret Manager compatible)

### API Changes
✅ **Additive only** - New routes added alongside legacy routes

---

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

### Route Shadowing in Express
- Express uses first-match-wins pattern
- More specific routes should be registered after generic ones
- Always test order of route registration
- Consider using route prefixes to avoid conflicts

### Swagger Automation
- Manual updates are error-prone
- Python scripts can validate and prevent duplicates
- Automation reduces maintenance burden
- Always validate generated YAML

### Environment Variables
- Standardize naming across all environments
- Use test mocks to catch inconsistencies
- Align with deployment platform conventions (GCP, AWS, etc.)
